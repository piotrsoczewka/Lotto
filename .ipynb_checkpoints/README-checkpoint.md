# Lotto
## 1) Introduction
Lotto is the biggest lottery set up in Poland. The main prize goes to those, who correctly select 6 out of 49 numbers and awards reach several dozens of millions of polish zlotys.

In this project, I am going to analyze data (money award, date, location of the winner) of Lotto main prizes over one million zlotys from the last 20+ years. The analysis will tell, if there are any monthly, yearly and locational patterns in Lotto's wins distribution. While potential findings will not answer how to score 6/6 numbers, it may bring valuable information Lotto's marketers on how, when and where people play Lotto in Poland.

This work is realised as the final project in "Data Analyst" bootcamp that I participated.
